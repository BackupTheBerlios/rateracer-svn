- (Use Ctrl-F5 to start program in Release!)
- Check stack and heap usage!
- fast sqrt etc
# pressing 'j' twice deadlocks program!
- Clamp all dot products where applicable! posDot(a,b)
- Simulated refractive thickness (for single-sided meshes with occluded edges)
- Use HDRI loader from AL, or cubemaps...
- GIF anim / AVI
- adaptive epsilon (ray length)? multiple epsilons?
- offset epsilon along normal instead (+ ray direction?)
- GetProfileInt/Struct, timing class
- path-branching at deeper levels if ray is specular/refracted...
- mark rectangle for subrendering!
- (turn slow stuff off while changing view? points etc)
- rerender when view has changed and stabilized, auto-hide preview
- better preview: fix all shape types
- render progress/timing output!
- camera class (incl ray handling), colorRGB class?
- more lightsrc subclasses! Calc lighting inside lightsrc class?
- parallel/directional light?
- move light around (fix last touches only!) (move to control class?)
- glow/halo, distance functions
- efficient ground/wall/roof plane tests
- hardcoded floor, headlight?
# STD_LOOP etc, or replace STL?
- gloss map, radial fog, fuzzy/fogged refl/refr
